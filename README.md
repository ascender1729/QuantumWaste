## Introduction

QuantumWaste is an innovative project that leverages quantum-inspired algorithms to simulate and optimize the recycling process for complex polymers. This cutting-edge application combines quantum computing concepts with materials science to explore new frontiers in sustainable waste management.

## Features

- Quantum-inspired optimization algorithm for polymer recycling
- Interactive 3D visualization of polymer structures
- Real-time simulation of recycling processes
- Dynamic charts displaying recycling difficulty and other metrics
- Machine learning model for predicting recycling difficulty
- Responsive web design for various device sizes

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React.js
  - Three.js (for 3D visualization)
  - Material-UI
  - Recharts (for data visualization)

- Backend:
  - Flask (Python)
  - PennyLane (for quantum-inspired algorithms)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

- Development Tools:
  - Git & GitHub (version control)
  - npm (package management)
  - Visual Studio Code (recommended IDE)

## System Architecture

QuantumWaste consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend**: A React-based web application that provides an interactive interface for visualizing polymer structures and simulation results.
2. **Backend**: A Flask server that handles quantum-inspired simulations, polymer modeling, and machine learning predictions.

These components interact as follows:

1. The frontend sends simulation parameters to the backend.
2. The backend processes these parameters using quantum-inspired algorithms and machine learning models.
3. The results are sent back to the frontend for visualization.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 14+
- npm 6+
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantumWaste.git
   cd QuantumWaste
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```
   cd src/backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```
   cd ../../src/frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Backend Configuration:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `src/backend` directory with any necessary environment variables.

2. Frontend Configuration:
   - If your backend is running on a different port or host, update the API URL in `src/frontend/src/config.js`.

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend:
   ```
   cd src/backend
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   python app.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend (in a new terminal):
   ```
   cd src/frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## API Documentation

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `POST /simulate`: Run a quantum-inspired simulation
- `GET /model`: Retrieve information about the current machine learning model

For detailed API documentation, refer to the comments in the `app.py` file.

## Frontend Structure

The frontend is organized as follows:

- `src/`
  - `components/`: React components
    - `PolymerVisualizer.js`: 3D visualization component
    - `SimulationForm.js`: Form for inputting simulation parameters
    - `ResultsDisplay.js`: Component for displaying simulation results
  - `App.js`: Root component
  - `index.js`: Entry point

## Backend Structure

The backend is structured as follows:

- `app.py`: Flask application and route definitions
- `quantum_algorithm.py`: Implementation of quantum-inspired algorithms
- `polymer_simulator.py`: Polymer structure simulation logic
- `models/`: Directory for machine learning models

## Data Flow

1. User inputs simulation parameters in the frontend
2. Parameters are sent to the backend via API call
3. Backend runs quantum-inspired simulation and ML prediction
4. Results are sent back to the frontend
5. Frontend updates the 3D visualization and charts

## Troubleshooting

- If the frontend fails to connect to the backend, ensure the backend is running and the API URL is correct in `config.js`.
- For issues with the 3D visualization, check the browser console for Three.js-related errors.
- If the quantum simulation fails, verify that PennyLane is properly installed and configured.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more complex quantum algorithms
- Add support for a wider range of polymer types
- Integrate with real-world recycling data
- Develop an API for external integrations
- Implement user authentication for saving simulations
